# bootstrap-hw

This homework is meant to integrate bootstrap into pre-existing html file in order to add responsiveness to components of the page like its layout. I attempted to add bootstrap functionality, however the code didn't seem to respond. I focused mainly on adjusting the layout to the content container. I had a flexbox with css from the prior homework, so I don't know if that was preventing bootstrap from making changes. I was concerned with deleting code in my style sheet in place of bootstrap, because the other pages (index and contact) use the same css style sheet and would be affected as well. I also know I have some redundancy within my css file. However, I don't have the ability to discern what's really needed and what's overwritten. Ideally, I would've wanted to have the 1 row adjust to 2 columns of 3 rows with 5 boxes as the page size is reduced.



What I took out of this assignment is that I need to go back to the beginning slides, activities, and other resources for bootstrap (as well as css) and structure what I learn. I don't think it's the assignment or the information but having to jump from place to place for each element that is confusing me and creating pockets in my knowledge.
