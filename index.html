        <p>
            My name is Thomas Sears. I'm a Montclair State University alumus with a B.S. in Biology and academic
            interests
            in cognitive science. Within the field of cognitive science, I'm most curious about memory, language
            acquisition, and meditation. What I ultimately want is to become a cognitive scientist and research ways
            to
            enhance our brain's ability to savant level or those with super-autobiographical memory! However, I'm
            also
            content with building a website/application that affords me financial freedom so I can sit back and
            relax.
            ^-^
            <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time, I like playing video games, watching movies/tv shows, and learning different ways to
            improve myself. Currently, I have a 5-year goal to learn 7 languages. In order, they are:

                <li>Spanish</li>
                <li>Japanese</li>
                <li>French</li>
                <li>German</li>
                <li>Mandarin Chinese</li>
